The aim of this software is to create graphs for showing the evolution of a player in the game www.goldenboys.fr.
For the moment this software product a .png graph that shows all stocks fluctuations relative to the gain for the user.

THIS SOFTWARE NEEDS:
	- Python 2.x
	- The Python "Scrapy" lib, for the web crawling.
	- The Python "Matplotlib" lib, for drawing the graphs.

HOW TO USE IT:
	Run gb_stats_maker/gb_stats.py --help for details.
